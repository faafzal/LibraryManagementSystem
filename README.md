# LibraryManagementSystem

The Library Management System allows users to borrow and return books from an online library. The library consists of ebooks. An admin can add new titles to the list of books. A user can borrow up to 5 books at any given time. A user can also see when the book is due. The due date is 7 days from when the book was borrowed. 

By default, new users are regular users and not admin users. To create an admin user, the admin must change the admin value to YES in RegisterController.java
